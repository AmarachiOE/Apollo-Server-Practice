Fetching Data with Resolvers
    - In order to respond to queries, a schema needs to have resolve functions for all fields called the "resolver map"
    - resolver map relates the schema fields and types to a function


Example Resolver Map:
    const { gql } = require('apollo-server');
    const { find, filter } = require('lodash');

    const schema = gql`
        type Book {
            title: String
            author: Author
        }

        type Author {
            books: [Book]
        }

        type Query {
            author: Author
        }
    `;

    # ########  RESOLVER MAP (note: relations between types... Query -- Author -- Book)

    const resolvers = {
        Query: {
            author(parent, args, context, info) {
            return find(authors, { id: args.id });
            },
        },

        Author: {
            books(author) {
            return filter(books, { author: author.name });
            },
        },
    };
