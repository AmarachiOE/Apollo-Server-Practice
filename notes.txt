Initialize Project
- new repo with readme on github
$ git clone <url>
$ cd <folder>
$ npm init --yes
$ npm install apollo-server graphql
$ touch index.js

1. Install dependencies

2. Define schema

3. Define data set

4. Resolver:
    - We've defined our data set, but Apollo Server doesn't know that it should use that data set when it's executing a query. To fix this, we create a resolver.

    - Resolvers tell Apollo Server how to fetch the data associated with a particular type. Because our Book array is hardcoded, the corresponding resolver is straightforward.


5. Create Instance of Apollo Server:
    - We've defined our schema, data set, and resolver. Now we just need to provide this information to Apollo Server when we initialize it.

    - Then run in command line $ node index.js

6. Test Queries:
    - Go to http://localhost:4000/
    - Test this query:
        {
            books {
                title
                author
            }
        }
