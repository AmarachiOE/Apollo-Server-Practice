Resolver:
We've defined our data set, but Apollo Server doesn't know that it should use that data set when it's executing a query. To fix this, we create a resolver.

Resolvers tell Apollo Server how to fetch the data associated with a particular type. Because our Book array is hardcoded, the corresponding resolver is straightforward.


Create Instance of Apollo Server:
We've defined our schema, data set, and resolver. Now we just need to provide this information to Apollo Server when we initialize it.

Then run in command line $ node index.js
